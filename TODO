- Add a way to reserve addresses in the mmap module
  This is needed because there are memory mapped devices
  like the LAPIC that shouldn't be accidentally used for
  arbitrary storage.

- MMAP module isn't very good at the moment. Some assumptions
  like always having available memory below 1GiB. Would like
  to dynamically allocate the mmap array instead of hard 
  coding the number of entries.
